# Apex Legends Radar Hack – See Everyone, Win Everything 📡💥

## Third-Parties? Surprise Pushes? Not Anymore.

Apex Legends is all about movement, positioning, and reading the map. But why guess where squads are when you can just **see them all** in real time? The **Apex Radar Hack** gives you full 360° tracking of every enemy on the map—no line of sight needed, no scans required. You’ll know where they are, where they’re rotating, and when they’re about to push… before they even see you.

This isn’t wallhack. This is **pure map control**. 🧠⚡

## 🧩 What Is a Radar Hack?

A **radar hack** is a cheat overlay that displays real-time enemy positions on a mini-map or HUD radar, regardless of walls, distance, or visibility. It works passively while you play and gives you total awareness of all threats and opportunities across the entire zone.

Whether you're landing Fragment or playing endgame circles, this mod keeps you two steps ahead. 🛰️
